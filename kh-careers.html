                <p>Page analytics and user behaviour analysis outlined any usability issues or pain-points that could be improved, as well as any design inconsistencies or opportunities for the new page. Insights from these user interactions and frustrations, as well as from the design evaluation of the page, resulted in the following opportunities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indicating clear calls to action</li>
                    <li>Repurposing and introducing new inspiring and engaging content through imagery and iconography</li>
                    <li>Removing tedious navigation to relevant information</li>
                    <li>Improving consistency in styling relative to the whole website</li>
                    <li>Succinctly expressing Kennards Hire as a business and what they have to offer</li>
                    <li>Building a balanced visual hierarchy</li>

                <p>Following brand guidelines was key when considering how Kennards Hire produces a distinction in the marketplace against competitors, as well as giving the brand it’s personality. Competitors and innovators were also looked at to find design inspiration and to gain an understanding of how their brand and messaging was adapted to suit their ideal candidates.</p>
