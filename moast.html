                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>
                    Moast was a radical redesign of an existing appliance (a toaster), where Arduino, Javascript and 3D printing were used to make a functioning lookalike model. Hygiene, portability, and toasting control were three user needs identified and resolved after extensive research and performance testing. These factors would likely be implemented more effectively into toasters of the future.

                <p>
                    The final design resulted in an ergonomic hand-held toaster featuring a powerful heating element allows the user to
                    produce the right amount of toasting control. The slimline exposed design allowed for little to no interaction with the
                    bread being toasted, removing the chance of cross gluten contamination and need for tedious cleaning. Lastly the
                    toasters small footprint was meant for maximum portability for on the go cooks, future technology allowing for capable
                    portable power.
