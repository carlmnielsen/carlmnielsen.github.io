                <h5>Summary</h5>
                <p>Creating an automated re-engagement campaign was part of setting up a first time contact cleaning process within
                Kennards Hire’s email marketing platform, Bronto.</p>
                <p>Inactive or unengaged contacts were being sent content that they potentially no longer wanted to engage with. These
                contacts were filtered out and sent through this automated re-engagement workflow where they could either confirm their
                engagement over two emails separated by a delay, or unsubscribe if they no longer wanted to receive content.</p>

                <h2>Design Considerations</h2>
                <p>The goal for asset creation in this email campaign was to produce an engaging hero
                banner that contact would see first. Also being considered when designing the above
                hero banners was Kennards Hire’s two most prevalent customer types, DIYers and
                tradies, as well as the Kennards Hire marketing major campaign which had only just
                launched just prior to this.</p>

                <h2>Final Design</h2>
                <p>The hero banner in the first message had to be eye catching
                and somewhat personal, as though a Kennards team member
                was reaching out to the user for as much possible engagement.
                The second messages banner needed to incentivise the contact
                not only though the clear discount code but also through strong
                actionable language targeted at the main customer types.</p>
                <p>All assets were created within Photoshop and Illustrator for both
                desktop and mobile views. These were then imported to Bronto
                where the rest of the message was created, jumping between a
                WYSIWYG content editor and HTML/CSS.</p>
