                <h5>Summary</h5>
                <p>The brief was to design a landing page for a EasyTrak, a Kennards Hire product that is targeted towards complex trade
                customers who are most of the time on site and across multiple projects. EasyTrak is a tool and ecosystem offering the
                acquisition and analysis of equipment data on site. It provides end-to-end site visibility positively impacting cost,
                servicing, productivity, safety, and environmental factors.</p>
                <p>
                The main challenges were the short time frame this had to be completed in and understanding the people who this page
                would be targeted towards. Ultimately this lead to creating an easy to understand and quickly digestable design
                utilising iconography, and relevant imagery.</p>

                <h2>Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
                <p>All wireframes were created in Figma following a review of existing EasyTrak content
                and assets. All new assets were created in Photoshop and illustrator and exported for
                digital usage.</p>
                <p>Initial designs had product value propositions placed lower on the page, however
                after review these were pushed to the top, alongside other product benefits.</p>

                <h2>Final Design</h2>
                <p>Once the high-fidelity wireframes were complete they were
                handed over for development along with related assets. The
                design was then tweaked on the website backend, Magento,
                until we were happy with the final result.
                </p>
                <p>
                This page was under ongoing performance review, using
                Google Analytics to understand who was viewing the page and
                if the content suited their needs correctly. Hotjar was also used
                to draw out any usability issues or behaviour patterns we could
                improve upon.</p>
